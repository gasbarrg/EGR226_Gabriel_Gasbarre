# EGR 226 - Microcontroller Programming and Applications - Winter 2020 / 2021 
The following information relates to the final project.   

Control system on the TI MSP432 Launchpad microcontroller with numeric Keypad and 16x4 LCD integration.  
Control system included the following additional hardware:  
• Servo Motor “Door” (PWM)  
• LED “Door Feedback” (GPIO)  
• DC Motor (PWM Speed) with Push-Button “Emergency Stop” (GPIO Interrupt)  
• RGB LEDs (PWM Brightness) with Push-Button RGB LED Enable/Disable (GPIO Interrupt)  
• Servo motor 3 Degree of Freedom Cylindrical Robotic Arm with three potentiometer controls   
• 3D Printed DC Motor Mount  

Control system included the following software constraints:   
• A Main Menu displayed on the LCD allowing the user to select between three options: (1) Door Menu (2) Motor Menu (3) Lights Menu  
• LCD Backlight brightness and contrast driven by PWM
